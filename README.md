## Final Project

Motivation:
	The motivation for this project was to try and see if there was a relationship between when babies were born and if there was a significant date 9 months prior. This eventually changed when we familiarized ourself with the data and realized that there wans't as strong of a correlation as we thought.

Summary of Findings:
	Although expecting families can plan as much as possible, there are many factors that can affect when a baby is brought into this world. Financial hardships, weekends, or holidays are some of the factors the bring births down. Signicatlly numbered days, middle of the week, and higher economy are some of the factors that bring births up.

Description of Data:
	Our dataset includes all US births from the year 2000 to 2014. It includes the `year`, `month`, `date_of_month`, `date`,`day_of_week`, and `births` recorded in the US.
