Our Dataset:

head(new_birth_data)
```


```{r}
new_birth_data2 <- new_birth_data[-c(1:8)]
head(new_birth_data2)
```

## Univariate Outlier Detection

From this new data set, we will look at the birth rates to perform univariate outlier detection.

```{r}
summary(new_birth_data2)
```

We can find the outliers by creating a boxplot:

```{r}
boxplot.stats(new_birth_data2$`Birth Rate`)$out
```

```{r}
boxplot(new_birth_data2$`Birth Rate`)
```

On this dataset, we can also perform multivariate outlier detection:
